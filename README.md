üéØ Overview

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease affecting 2-3% of the global population. This CDSS provides a structured, evidence-based approach to psoriasis evaluation through four integrated assessment modules:

    Introduction & Patient Registration - Clinical overview and patient data collection

    Diagnostic Matrix - Visual diagnostic screening tool

    Type Identification - Psoriasis subtype classification

    Severity Assessment - Comprehensive PASI, BSA, and DLQI evaluation

The system is designed for use by dermatologists, general practitioners, medical students, and researchers.
